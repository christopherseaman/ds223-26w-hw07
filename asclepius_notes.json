    "note": "Discharge Summary:\n\nThis discharge summary pertains to Antoine, a 13-year-old male who was brought to Ontario, Canada from the United States by his mother. Antoine made allegations of childhood abuse and severe physical discipline from his father, who was a joint legal guardian. He also identified as gay and feared a return to his father's home due to conservative religious beliefs that would not permit him to express his sexual identity.\n\nAntoine was assessed by a Forensic Psychiatrist who reported he was a \"mature minor,\" capable of understanding and appreciating the nature and consequences of his decisions, particularly those related to determining his country of residence. He also exhibited significant depressive symptoms that met criteria for Major Depressive Disorder.\n\nAn expert in Parental Alienation Syndrome (PAS) provided an opinion regarding Antoine's case. PAS is defined as a constellation of symptoms resulting from \"brainwashing\" by one parent resulting in the child's subsequent vilification of the target parent. The RSW concluded that Antoine's requests were not independent and should not be considered by the courts due to alleged \"brainwashing\" by his mother. The RSW offered a diagnosis of PAS in their assessment.\n\nUltimately, the court ruled that the child could pursue protections through local jurisdictional entities in the US and Antoine was returned to the custody of his father in the US.\n\nThis discharge summary serves as a brief overview and does not include any clinical information or details beyond what was explicitly mentioned in the case report."

Additionally, he suffered from mild hypertension and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.\n\nHospital Course:\nThe patient was admitted with a suspected metastasis of sigmoid cancer in Couinaud segment 7. An abdominal ultrasound was performed, and a CT scan was ordered. The CT scan showed a liver metastasis in Couinaud segment 7 with a size of 2.2 \u00d7 2.4 cm that was closely attached to the right hepatic vein. Analysis of the CT scan revealed that the proximal part of the middle hepatic vein was completely missing, whereas its distal branches seemed to be open. An additional 3D imaging of the case was done to get more detailed information about the anatomical situation. As the non-existence of a middle hepatic vein may have led to insufficient drainage of remnant hepatic parenchyma following a bisegmental resection of CS 6 and 7, a right-sided hemihepatectomy was performed.
